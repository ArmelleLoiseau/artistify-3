## Day III - Authentication (end @ 18h00)

Today, we'll implement a full signup/signin/signout system.  
To do so, we'll learn about session mechanism in express and bcrypt hashing algorithm.  
We will also protect the dashboard routes with custom middlewares.  
Finally, we will use other custom middlewares and flash messages to display hints to our end users.

This is a huge step and will become handy during module II project week !
Use the auth appliction provided in class to complete the todo list.  

**Don't worry** if you can't finish all the steps : you will get a soluce proposal.

**Do your best : Happy hacking !**

### The User model

The User model should be located in /models/User.js

The User model must have the following properties :

- username - String  
- email - String, unique  
- password - String (must be encrypted)  
- role - String, enum: ["admin", "user"], default: "user"  
- avatar - String (default:https://res.cloudinary.com/gdaconcept/image/upload/v1614762472/workshop-artistify/default-profile_tbiwcc.jpg)  

### The auth router

The auth router should be located in /routes/auth.js .  
All those routes are **prefixed** with /auth  

<br/>
Here is a routes description:  

| Route         | HTTP | View                       | Description                                          |
| ------------- | ---- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `/signin`     | GET  | auth/signin.hbs            | Display signin form                                  |
| `/signup `    | GET  | auth/signup.hbs            | Display signup form                                  |
| `/signout`    | GET  | none                       | Destroy the session and redirect to signin           |
| `/signin`     | POST | none                       | Executes the signin process                          |
| `/signup`     | POST | none                       | Executes the signup process                          |
